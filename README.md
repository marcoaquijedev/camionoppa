- 👋 Hi, I’m @camionoppa. I'm from Perú and I just started this journey. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and 3D animations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, html, css. Maybe in the future I can learn another languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can. I'm really excited to learn and help other people.
